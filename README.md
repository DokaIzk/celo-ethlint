## Introduction
Smart contracts have become an integral part of the blockchain ecosystem, and they have numerous use cases ranging from decentralized finance to supply chain management. However, the security of these smart contracts is a critical concern, and vulnerabilities in smart contracts can result in significant losses. Ethlint is a tool that can help developers identify potential security issues in their smart contracts and ensure that they are writing secure code.

This tutorial will provide a comprehensive guide on how to secure your Celo smart contracts using Ethlint. We will begin by discussing the prerequisites for using Ethlint, and then we will explore Ethlint and its importance in smart contract security. We will then move on to installing and configuring Ethlint, integrating it with Hardhat, writing secure smart contracts with Ethlint, and deploying on Celo.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have a basic understanding of smart contracts, JavaScript and Solidity. You should also have experience with the development tools used for Celo smart contract development, including Hardhat.

## Understanding Ethlint and Its Importance in Smart Contract Security

Ethlint is a linter for Solidity code that analyzes smart contracts and identifies potential security vulnerabilities. It is an open-source tool that is widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem and is a valuable tool for smart contract developers.

The importance of Ethlint in smart contract security cannot be overstated. Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts can result in significant losses for users and developers. Ethlint helps identify potential security issues in smart contracts, making it an essential tool for smart contract developers.

## What Is Celo?

Celo is a blockchain platform that aims to create a more accessible and inclusive financial system by providing a platform for building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Celo aims to reduce the barriers to entry for people who may not have access to traditional financial services, such as bank accounts and credit cards, by allowing them to transact using their mobile phones.

One of the key features of the Celo platform is its focus on mobile-first design, which allows users to easily interact with dApps and smart contracts using their smartphones. Celo also supports stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a specific asset, such as the US dollar, to provide stability and predictability in their value.

The Celo platform uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which allows token holders to participate in the governance of the network and earn rewards for staking their tokens. The Celo native token is called CELO, and it is used for paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in the governance of the network.

## Installing Ethlint

Before you can use Ethlint, you need to install and configure it. Ethlint can be installed using npm, the Node.js package manager.

Open a terminal and type the following command to install Ethlint:

```bash
    npm install -g ethlint
```

This will install Ethlint globally on your system. Once Ethlint is installed, you can run it on your smart contracts to identify potential security issues.

## Integrating Ethlint With Hardhat

Integrating Ethlint with Hardhat is a straightforward process. Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum that provides a testing framework, a task runner, and other tools that make smart contract development easier. Hardhat also supports Ethlint out of the box.

To integrate Ethlint with Hardhat, we need to install the following packages:

```bash
    npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai
```

Next, initialize a new Hardhat JavaScript Project using the following command:

```bash
    npx hardhat init
```

Once the project is initialized, Copy and paste the following code into the `hardhat.config.js` file:

```javascript
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

const PRIVATE_KEY = "";

module.exports = {
	solidity: {
		version: "0.8.0",
	},

	networks: {
		hardhat: {},
		alfajores: {
			url: "https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org",
			chainId: 44787,
			accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
		},
	},
};
```
>**_Note_**: If you don't know how to retrieve your private key, here's a [guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key) that explains the steps.

Finally, you need to initialize the Ethlint to be able to use it in the project. You can do so by using the following command:

```bash
 solium --init
```

## Writing Secure Smart Contracts With Ethlint

Now that you have Ethlint installed and integrated with Hardhat, you can begin writing secure smart contracts.

The following are some best practices to keep in mind when writing smart contracts:

1. Use the latest version of Solidity: The latest version of Solidity includes important security improvements, so it is important to keep your contracts up to date.
2. Avoid using `tx.origin`: The `tx.origin` variable can be manipulated by attackers to perform unauthorized actions. It is recommended to use `msg.sender` instead.
3. Avoid using uninitialized storage: Uninitialized storage can contain sensitive information, so it is important to initialize all storage variables properly.
4. Avoid using deprecated Solidity functions: Deprecated functions may have security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior, so it is important to use up-to-date functions.
5. Use modifiers to enforce access control: Modifiers can be used to restrict access to certain functions or variables. Always use modifiers to enforce access control in your smart contracts.
6. Use events to log important actions: Events can be used to log important actions in your smart contracts. This can help with debugging and auditing.

Now let's look at an example of a smart contract that uses Ethlint to identify potential security issues. We will write a simple contract that stores a list of users and their balances:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UserBalances {
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[tx.origin] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[tx.origin] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[tx.origin] -= amount;
        payable(tx.origin).send(amount);
    }
    
    function getBalance(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[user];
    }
}

```
Let's go through the code line by line;
```solidity
  contract UserBalances{}
```
`contract UserBalances`: starts the contract declaration for a contract called UserBalances.

```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances
```
- Declares a mapping named `balances` that maps addresses to unsigned integers, where the addresses represent users and the integers represent the balances of those users.
- The `private` keyword makes the mapping accessible only within the contract and not from outside.

```solidity
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[tx.origin] += msg.value;
    }
```

- Defines a function called `deposit` that is marked as `public` and `payable`, meaning it can receive ETH when called.
- Adds the value sent with the function call (`msg.value`) to the balance of the user calling the function (`tx.origin`).

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[tx.origin] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[tx.origin] -= amount;
        payable(tx.origin).send(amount);
    }
```
- Defines a function called `withdraw` that is marked as `public`.
- Checks that the balance of the user calling the function (`tx.origin`) is greater than or equal to the specified `amount`.
- Subtracts the specified `amount` from the balance of the user calling the function (`tx.origin`).
- Sends the specified `amount` of ETH to the user calling the function (`tx.origin`).

```solidity
    function getBalance(address user) public view returns (uint256){
        return balances[user];
        }
```

- Defines a function called `getBalance` that is marked as `public` and `view`.
Takes an `address` parameter called `user` and returns the balance of that user in the `balances` mapping.
The `view` keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the contract.

There are potential security vulnerabilities that Ethlint can help us identify in this contract.

To run Ethlint on this contract, you can use the following command:

```bash
    solium -f contracts/UserBalances.sol
```

This will compile the contract and run Ethlint on it. Ethlint will identify potential security issues and provide suggestions for how to fix them.

Here is an example of the output from Ethlint:

```bash
contracts/UserBalances.sol
  6:4      warning    Line contains trailing whitespace                       no-trailing-whitespace
  8:17     error      Consider using 'msg.sender' in place of 'tx.origin'.    security/no-tx-origin
  10:4     warning    Line contains trailing whitespace                       no-trailing-whitespace
  12:25    error      Consider using 'msg.sender' in place of 'tx.origin'.    security/no-tx-origin
  13:17    error      Consider using 'msg.sender' in place of 'tx.origin'.    security/no-tx-origin
  14:8     warning    Consider using 'transfer' in place of 'send'.           security/no-send
  14:16    error      Consider using 'msg.sender' in place of 'tx.origin'.    security/no-tx-origin
  16:4     warning    Line contains trailing whitespace                       no-trailing-whitespace

✖ 4 errors, 4 warnings found.
```

Ethlint has identified two potential security issues in our contract:
1. The first warning is about the use of `tx.origin`, which we can fix by using `msg.sender` instead.
2. The second warning is about the use of the `send` function, which we can fix by using the `transfer` function instead.


We will now fix these issues by updating our smart contract's code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UserBalances {
    
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;
    
    event Deposit(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
    event Withdraw(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] + msg.value;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - amount;
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount);
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
    
    function getBalance(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[user];
    }
}
```

You have fixed the potential security issues identified by Ethlint:

  1. You have replaced `tx.origin` with `msg.sender` in the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions.
  2. You have replaced the `send` function with the `transfer` pattern.
  3. You have added deposit and withdraw events to log important actions.

Use the following command once again to ensure that the issues have been fixed:

```bash
solium -f contracts/UserBalances.sol
```


With these fixes, your contract is now more secure and less vulnerable to attacks.

## Writing Tests for the Contract

Here's an example of how to write a test for the UserBalances contract using JavaScript, Hardhat, and Chai:

```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("UserBalances", function () {
  let userBalances;
  let owner;
  let addr1;

  beforeEach(async function () {
    // Deploy the UserBalances contract
    const UserBalances = await ethers.getContractFactory("UserBalances");
    userBalances = await UserBalances.deploy();
    await userBalances.deployed();

    // Get the signers
    [owner, addr1] = await ethers.getSigners();
  });

  it("should deposit and withdraw funds", async function () {
    expect(await userBalances.getBalance(addr1.address)).to.equal(0);
    // Deposit 100 wei from address 1
    await userBalances.connect(addr1).deposit({ value: 100 });
    expect(await userBalances.getBalance(addr1.address)).to.equal(100);

    // Withdraw 50 wei from address 1
    await userBalances.connect(addr1).withdraw(50);
    expect(await userBalances.getBalance(addr1.address)).to.equal(50);

    // Attempt to withdraw more than the balance, should fail
    await expect(userBalances.connect(addr1).withdraw(100)).to.be.revertedWith(
      "Insufficient balance"
    );
    expect(await userBalances.getBalance(addr1.address)).to.equal(50);
  });

  it("should emit Deposit and Withdraw events", async function () {
    // Deposit 100 wei from owner
    const depositTx = await userBalances.deposit({ value: 100 });
    await depositTx.wait();

    // Withdraw 50 wei from owner
    expect(await userBalances.withdraw(50)).to.emit(userBalances, "Deposit")
    .withArgs(owner.address, 100);
  });
});
```

This test suite uses the Chai assertion library and the `ethers` library provided by Hardhat to interact with the `UserBalances` contract. The `beforeEach` hook deploys a new instance of the contract and sets up `owner` and `addr1` as signers for testing. The first test case checks that the deposit and withdraw functions work as expected, while the second test case checks that the `Deposit` and `Withdraw` events are emitted correctly.


You can run this script by using the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Deploying on the Celo Alfajores Network

1. Create a JavaScript file deploy.js in the root of your project with the following contents:

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const UserBalances = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("UserBalances");
  const userBalances = await UserBalances.deploy();
  await userBalances.deployed();
  console.log("UserBalances deployed to:", userBalances.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

This file uses Hardhat to deploy the `UserBalances` contract to the Celo network. When you run this script, it will compile the contract and deploy it to the specified network.

2. Run the deploy.js script:

```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network alfajores
```
This command will deploy the contract to the Alfajores testnet.

3. View the deployed contract on the Celo Explorer:

Once the contract is deployed, you can view it on the Celo Explorer by following these steps:

- Go to the **[Celo Alfajores explorer](https://explorer.celo.org/alfajores)**
- In the search bar, enter the address of your contract that was previously logged to the console
- Click on the contract that appears to view its details


Congratulations, you have successfully deployed your smart contract on the Celo network!
